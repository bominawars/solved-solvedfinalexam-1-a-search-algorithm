QUESTION 7

1. The binary search algorithm

is less efficient than the sequential search algorithm

will have a maximum number of comparisons equal to the number of elements in the array

will cut the portion of the array being searched in half each time the loop fails to locate the search value

will have an average of N/2 comparisons, where N is the number of elements in the array6 points

QUESTION 8

}return maxPos;}The missing code is

if (array[k] array[maxPos]) maxPos = k;

if (array[k] array[maxPos]) return maxPos;

if (array[k] maxPos) return maxPos;

if (array[k] array[maxPos]) k = maxPos;6 points
